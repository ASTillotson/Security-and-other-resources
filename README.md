# Security-and-other-resources
A compilation of security resources and tools that I will be curating over my career. Many of the resources are papers that I have written for classes that summarize a complex issue into a short, 1-2 page report of the issue. These reports are perfect for briefing someone who is knowledgeable in the field of Cyber Security on an issue.

### **Various Youtube videos and lectures**

The entirety of Professor Messer's Youtube channel is a valuable resource when researching for Security+, Network+, A+ or other Cyber Security Related certifications. He offers paid for notes and such but all of the lectures and educational content is free on Youtube.
